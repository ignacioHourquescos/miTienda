# La Galera Market
This project was presented as in a React Course which I undertook in Dec. 2020 in CoderHouse.
It was created with React and firebase as de databse, for a brand name "La Galera" which sells dely products 

## UX Experimental purchasing
Certain products of the market have special discounts. it may be a discount in %, a bonus etc. The ones who do have a discount will show the hat icon.
when clicked the promotion will be exposed. The market aldo offers a shortcut to adding articles to the cart in a fast way by adding clicking on "agregar" button
