Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />


### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!
